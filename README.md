# GithubSearch

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.2.

I know you are an awesome developer, so you always want to help to keep your favorite repositories in the best condition and 'issueless'.
Just type you favorite repo name in the searchbar, hit enter or click the magnifier icon button.

Github only allows to get the first 1000 repos, but it is good enough.

After you got all the repos, you can see some basic information of them. The most important is the 'Open issues' badge. This will change its color based on the issue number. Just click it then you will see the issues on a popup panel.

## Install

Run `npm install` to get the dependencies for the run.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
